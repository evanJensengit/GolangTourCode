Docker
So this is able to put an image on a server (my comp is a server) and then if
that server goes down the image can be placed on a different server. Helps because
if something breaks we can just get rid of that image (which is transient anyways)
and replace the image with a copy 

Questions: why do I have to build the docker image againgetting started 


what is an image 
what is a container
