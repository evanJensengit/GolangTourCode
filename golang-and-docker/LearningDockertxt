Docker
So this is able to put an image on a server (my comp is a server) and then if
that server goes down the image can be placed on a different server. Helps because
if something breaks we can just get rid of that image (which is transient anyways)
and replace the image with a copy 

Questions: why do I have to build the docker image again getting started 


what is an image 
what is a container

According to Tech school Backend#2

A Container is one instance of the application in the image. 
We start containers from an image. 

docker run --name postgres12 -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -d postgres:12-alpine
